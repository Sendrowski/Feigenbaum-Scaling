# Feigenbaum-Scaling
Mathematica code supplementary to a bachelorâ€™s thesis about Feigenbaum scaling  

The code generates all diagrams that can be found in 'figures'.  
It also computes the spectrum of the linearized peiod-doublding operater and the Feigenvalues via the direct method  

The file 'getFeigenbaum.wl' is a package and needs to be included in a directory contained in $PATH  

The following files can be found:  
CobwebPlot.nb - creation of the cobweb plots  
Feigenbaum Scaling.pdf - the written presentation of the thesis  
Feigenvalues.nb - computation of the generalized Feigenvalues and a plot of the superstable fixed-point equation  
FinalStateDiagram.nb - creation of all final-state diagrams  
getFeigenbaum.wl - computation of the Feigenvalues via the direct method  
OrbitDistribution.nb - histragram plot at the Feigenbaum point and the end point  
Plot3D.nb - 3D-Plot of f(mu,x)  
PoincarePlot.nb - Poincare plot of f  
SchwarzianDerivative.nb - plot of the Schwarzian derivative of f  
SelfSimilarity.nb - all plots involving the self-similarity of the graph of f to higher iterates  
Spectrum.nb - computation of the spectrum of the linearized period-doubling operator
